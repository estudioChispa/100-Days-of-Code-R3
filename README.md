#### R3D004 - July 12, Thursday
#100DaysofCode #iOS #Swift Today's topic is "Creating a State Machine Using Swift Enumerations." I will definitely be using this approach in an upcomning app. Glad I found this video on @BigNerdRach The Frontier.

"As View Controllers become more complex, the need to manage the state of the view becomes more important. In this video we will discuss how to use a state machine to manage our views state. After this video you will know how to build a state machine using enumerations in Swift and how to apply that to your code."

#100DaysofCode #iOS #Swift One more day of screenscasts on @BigNerdRanch "The Frontier". Another interesting topic - Using Container Views to Manage Complex Layouts. Their example was perhaps too simple, but I'll play around with an example related to my next app idea and see how it goes.

"When you have a complex view controller view, sometimes it is helpful to break up the view into manageable chunks. We’ll show you how easy it is to break up the implementation of a single view controller into multiple views just by using container views. Using container views can encourage code reuse as well as simplifying complex view controllers."

#### R3D002 - July 10, Tuesday
#100DaysofCode #iOS #Swift Really enjoying the screencasts from @BigNerdRanch 's The Frontier. Today I've watched one on Configurations vs. Schemes and one on Dynamic Stack Views. Learned a lot from both, but the Dynamic Stack Views are something I can implement right away.

"Targets and configurations and schemes; Oh my! Confused by these Xcode concepts? Curious how using multiple build configurations coupled with schemes can avoid the multiple-target mess? If you’re wondering what this all means and how it can make your developer life better, this video is for you. 

Questions we'll answer in this video: 

- What is an Xcode (build) configuration?
- What is an Xcode scheme?
- What’s the difference between a configuration and a scheme?
- How do I use build configurations?
- How do I use schemes?
- How do schemes make my life easier?
- How do configurations make my life easier. "

"How to use a UIStackView to manage dynamic content. This is a lightweight option when you do not need all of the capabilities of a UITableView."

#### R3D001 - July 9, Monday
#100DaysofCode #iOS #Swift Starting round 3! The first few days I'm going to run through some screencasts from Big Nerd Ranch's "The Frontier." Today's topic is Swift Assertions.

"In this screencast, we’ll learn how to use Swift’s assertion function to code defensively. By the end of this video, you’ll be able to use the assertion functions to help you write stronger, more robust code. "
