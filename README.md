#100DaysofCode #iOS #Swift Starting round 3! The first few days I'm going to run through some screencasts from Big Nerd Ranch's "The Frontier." Today's topic is Swift Assertions.

"In this screencast, we’ll learn how to use Swift’s assertion function to code defensively. By the end of this video, you’ll be able to use the assertion functions to help you write stronger, more robust code. "
