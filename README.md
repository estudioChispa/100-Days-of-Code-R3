#### R3D002 - July 10, Tuesday
#100DaysofCode #iOS #Swift Today's topic is Configurations vs. Schemes. Really enjoying the screencasts from Big Nerd Ranch. 

"Targets and configurations and schemes; Oh my! Confused by these Xcode concepts? Curious how using multiple build configurations coupled with schemes can avoid the multiple-target mess? If you’re wondering what this all means and how it can make your developer life better, this video is for you. 

Questions we'll answer in this video: 

- What is an Xcode (build) configuration?
- What is an Xcode scheme?
- What’s the difference between a configuration and a scheme?
- How do I use build configurations?
- How do I use schemes?
- How do schemes make my life easier?
- How do configurations make my life easier. "

#### R3D001 - July 9, Monday
#100DaysofCode #iOS #Swift Starting round 3! The first few days I'm going to run through some screencasts from Big Nerd Ranch's "The Frontier." Today's topic is Swift Assertions.

"In this screencast, we’ll learn how to use Swift’s assertion function to code defensively. By the end of this video, you’ll be able to use the assertion functions to help you write stronger, more robust code. "
